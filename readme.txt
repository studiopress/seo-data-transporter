This plugin allows you to transfer your inputs SEO data from one theme/plugin to another.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to transfer your inputs SEO data from one theme/plugin to another. We all know how difficult it can be to switch themes or dump plugins. The fact that themes and plugins store their inputs SEO data differently makes it even harder. This plugin remedies that.

Just choose what platform your moving away from, and what platform you want to move to. Click "analyze" to see what records and elements are compatible, and click "convert" to make the conversion.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin or theme I use (or want to use) isn't included. Will you include it? =

Probably. If it is a paid theme or plugin, the author will have to provide a copy for us to analyze. If it's free, and demand is high enough, we'll include it.

= How stable is this plugin? I don't want to lose all my SEO. =

It's relatively stable. This plugin has been in the repository since August, 2010, and no one has reported any problems. As always, be sure to keep a backup of your site, just to be safe.
